The aim of this project is to create a deep learning model for bird classification, that will eventually be built into an API. It leverages pre-trained models like ResNet to classify bird species from a given dataset.

## Installation

1) Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/johnhangen/Bird_API
    cd Bird_API
    ```

2) Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3) Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4) Make sure to download the [dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/nabirds) and place it in the data/ folder.

## Usage

To train the model, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Methodology 

We started with a pre-trained ResNet-50 model from ImageNet to take advantage of transfer learning and speed up training. ResNet-50 is a great choice because its deep architecture, powered by residual connections, helps with efficient feature learning and prevents vanishing gradients. We then fine-tuned the model on the NABirds dataset from Cornell, applying data augmentation to make it more robust. Training ran for 10 epochs on a T4 GPU, and we saw a steady improvement in accuracy with loss trending downâ€”promising results for our first run!

## TODO

-create API

-need to use trained model for segmentation
